# Bidirectional LSTM and GRU for Activity Recognition

This repository contains the implementation of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models in the user identification from walking activity for classification task. The dataset used is human activity data measured using an accelerometer with numerical features including: acceleration on the x, y, and z axes and corresponding labels.
